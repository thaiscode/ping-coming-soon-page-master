## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS vanilla
- BEM

### What I learned

I used this challenge to delve deeper into front-end validations, where I learned the basic regex definitions, the pattern attribute in html and the checkValidity() method in js.

### Continued development

I intend to continue improving my validations on the front-end, learning more about how to use regex.
